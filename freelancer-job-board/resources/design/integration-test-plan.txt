Database Integration Test Plan

Happy Path Test Cases:

* Create a new user and verify it's stored correctly.
* Post a job and ensure it appears in the job list.
* Submit a job application and retrieve it by freelancer.

Corner Cases:

* Applying to the same job twice (should prevent or update).
* Logging in with incorrect credentials (should reject).
* Posting a job with invalid category\_id (should error).

Success Criteria:

* Each test verifies expected database state after insert/update.
* Invalid inputs result in correct error messages or exceptions.
* Role-based access is enforced (freelancers can't post jobs, clients can't apply).

Mock Data:

* Users:

  * Client: userId=1, role=client
  * Freelancer: userId=2, role=freelancer
* Categories:

  * category\_id=1, name="Web Development"
* Jobs:

  * jobs\_id=1, posted\_by=1
* Skills:

  * skill\_id=1, user\_id=2
* Applications:

  * application\_id=1, freelancer\_id=2, job\_id=1
